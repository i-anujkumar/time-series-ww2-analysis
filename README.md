## 📌 Project Context

> ✅ This project was done during a data science course and is primarily based on a Kaggle notebook. It was adapted and customized for learning purposes.

---

## 📊 Sample Questions Explored

- How did aerial operations vary over time?
- Were there seasonal patterns?
- How did weather correlate with operation frequency?
